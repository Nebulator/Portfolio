    title: "Software Developer Intern: BYU-Pathway",
    date: "Jan 2021 - May 2021",
    description: "During an internship with BYU-Pathway, I helped maintain and build up the BYU Pathway Portal and Online Degree Portal. These applications used C# and React, as well as .net5. I developed modules such as the certificate and courses modules. These and similar modules required me to be familiar manipulate the database for testing purposes. I worked closely with the designers and standardized some styles across the two apps and made the UI cleaner, especially on the mobile view. Our team was striving to reach Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). My main contribution in this area was writing the first unit tests for the two portals. This not only pushed us closer to CI/CD, but it also gave my coworkers examples they could use as a reference.",

    title: "Assember, Virtual Machine and Compiler",
    date: "Aug 2020 - Dec 2020",
    description: "For my capstone project at Utah Valley University, I built a virtual machine and assembler in C++ and a matching compiler in C#. It was designed to read a language our professor, Dr. Curtis Wellborn, had created called kxi2020. It can use objects, functions and arrays. While this was one of the most stressful projects I've worked on, it has also been one of my favorites. I am unable to upload the code for these due to the possibility of future students using it, but feel free to download the executable and some sample programs.",

    description: "As QA intern at the Curch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I wrote and executed hundreds tests for several internal integrated applications. I approved or disapproved the release of these applications with their current builds. For the most part, however, I focused on one specific application and it's legacy version. I worked with the developers daily so I could understand the intended behavior and point out where the actual behavior didn't match it. Since this was an agile developement, there wasn't a lot of current documentation. When I finished my internship, because I understood this application better than the rest of the QA team, I wrote documentation for it regarding what it's purpose was and it's intended behavior and functionality.",

    title: "Education: Utah Valley University",
    date: "Aug 2013 - Dec 2020",
    description: "While at Utah Valley University, I earned two bachelor's degrees, one in Computer Engineering and one in Computer Science, not to mention my Associate's Degree of Science. While taking courses for my Computer Engineering degree, I took one in which I built an assembler and virtual machine. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and heard that the capstone project in the Computer Science track was building a compiler that used them. A combination of this realization, noting that I was really struggling and not enjoying my Computer Engineering senior project, and seeing that only one more year would be required, I decided to earn a degree in Computer Science as well. I ended up with a GPA of 3.78",

    description: "Several of my courses at UVU utilized programming in various object-oriented programming languages, so I decided to become a grader for the fundamental C++ Object-Oriented Programming course. I graded the programs submitted by the students and gave clear and helpful feedback, pointing out anything that seemed exceptional, where they could do better, and why they may have missed some points. Later, when I took a course in analysis of algorithms, the professor saw me excelling and asked me to be his grader for the next semester. I again did what I could to give helpful feedback, and, on multiple occasions, made corrections to the professor's own math and answer sheets. I received high praise from him for my work.",

    description: "I spent some time working as a volunteer with FamilySearch, of whom mainly focuses on helping people learn their family history. While there I determined whether scanned documents had any relevant information as well as index that information from other documents. While there I became a trainer for other volunteers, a tech specialist and an unofficial secretary to the manager. I would have liked to continue longer, but due to some unexpected health issues, I was forced to quit and take time to recover.",

    date: "May 2020 - Aug 2020",
    description: "During the summer of 2020, I picked up developing games as a hobby. Games are a very influential form of media because unlike other media like books, movies or music, the player interacts directly with the game and has their own impact. This removes certain barriers. They reach a point where they stop thinking, \"This character needs to do this\" to \"I need to do this.\" There is so much potential in this, and I believe it can be better utilized to help people grow. I hope to one day develop a full game and use it to help someone else.",

Our most recent project has been the Ghost Sight trilogy. I was cast as a minor character who died in the first film. I still wanted to be a part of this project so I've acted as prop specialist, boom mic operator and occasionally photographer. The first two entries in the Ghost Sight trilogy, \"Into the Dark\" and \"Tangled Threads\" have been uploaded to Youtube along with their trailers, bloopers and interviews. The final entry of the series, \"Moths to the Flame,\" premiers at the end of July.",
