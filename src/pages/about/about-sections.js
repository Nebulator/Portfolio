    description: "Hey there! I'm Nathaniel Cook. I studied at Utah Valley University and earned two bachelor's degrees: one in Computer Science and one in Computer Engineering. I've worked as a grader for classes in C# and computer algorithms. I have also had two internships with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints: one as a QA and one as a Software Engineer. I've come to love computers and their endless potential. The idea that we can create something fantastic and reproduce it with very low cost is astounding. There's a thrill for me when I explore how to overcome a programming problem, like an open ended puzzle. There's lot's of ways to solve it, but what method will do the job the best? As a hobby, I started developing games. They are a form of media that has great potential and I believe that they can be used to help people grow and progress through life.",
